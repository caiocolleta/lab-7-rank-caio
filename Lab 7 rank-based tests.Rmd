Hi this is Caio and I created this repo and markdown document

COLLABORATOR (TERESA) is going to make some histograms.

```{r}

# load packages and read in data

library (tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

# make a histogram 

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x=Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)


kermit_hist
```

Creator: doing some rank-based tests

# Is there a significant difference in pre-talk kermit scores for males an females?

# unpaired: Mann-Whitney U

```{r}

mwu_kermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)

mwu_kermit

```
