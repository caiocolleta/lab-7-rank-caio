Hi this is Caio and I created this repo and markdown document

COLLABORATOR (TERESA) is going to make some histograms.

```{r}

# load packages and read in data

library (tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

# make a histogram 

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x=Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)


kermit_hist
```
